## What it does

Social Radar turns noisy public content into something you can actually read and reuse.

- Search X by keyword and export a clean HTML report
- Crawl your following timeline and rank posts by usefulness
- Pull full answers from Zhihu questions or keyword results
- Pull all activities from a Zhihu user profile, including answer/article/pin/video links and full text exports
- Pull Xiaohongshu note lists, full text, images, and comments
- Pull Folo timeline data with your own cookie inside the same web console
- Track progress in a local web console instead of staring at terminal logs
- Persist tasks locally so history survives page refreshes and service restarts
- Highlight the most actionable efficiency posts and the most research-inspiring AI posts
- Explain why each highlighted item matters in Chinese inside the ranking page

This repo is built for people doing:

- content research
- market monitoring
- creator scouting
- lead discovery
- trend validation

## Why people star this kind of repo

It has three traits that travel well on GitHub:

- One-sentence value proposition: "turn social media into ranked reports"
- Visual output: generated HTML pages are screenshot-friendly
- Zero platform API dependency for X: it runs on your logged-in browser session

## Demo

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-name/social-radar.git
cd social-radar
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m playwright install chromium
```

Login to X once:

```bash
python login_x.py --state auth_state.json --timeout 180
```

Start the console:

```bash
python web_app.py
```

Then open:

```bash
http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

## Fastest path to first result

1. Run `python web_app.py`
2. Open the browser console
3. Enter an X keyword, or use the Folo panel
4. Start a `Top 500` search
5. Wait for the report to finish
6. Open the generated HTML output

If your first run does not produce a shareable screenshot in under 10 minutes, the repo is not packaged well enough. That is the standard.

## Core workflows

### 1. X keyword search

```bash
python search_keyword_500.py --keyword "AI Agent" --lang zh
```

Output:

- keyword search results
- full-text hydration
- HTML article page
- usefulness ranking page
- highlighted panels for "efficiency-first" and "AI research inspiration"
- Chinese recommendation reasons for each highlighted post

### 2. X following timeline ranking

```bash
python crawl_following_timeline_500.py
```

Output:

- latest following timeline items
- ranked report by usefulness
- HTML summaries for review
- two extra curation blocks for high-efficiency content and AI research inspiration

### 3. Zhihu question answers

```bash
python zhihu_question_answers.py \
  --question-url "https://www.zhihu.com/question/547768388" \
  --cookie "<your cookie>"
```

### 4. Zhihu keyword top 500

```bash
python zhihu_search_keyword_500.py \
  --keyword "自动驾驶强化学习" \
  --cookie "<your cookie>"
```

### 5. Zhihu user full activity export

```bash
python zhihu_user_activities.py \
  --user-url "https://www.zhihu.com/people/youkaichao" \
  --cookie "<your cookie>"
```

Output:

- `profile.json`
- `activity_links.json`
- `full_contents.json`
- `activities.csv`
- `summary.md`
- `article.html`

Answer extraction now retries transient browser failures such as `ERR_NETWORK_CHANGED`, then falls back to the Zhihu answer detail API so CSV exports keep full answer text instead of leaving blanks.

### 6. Xiaohongshu keyword top 500

```bash
python xiaohongshu_search_keyword_500.py \
  --keyword "AI 副业" \
  --cookie "<your cookie>"
```

### 7. Folo timeline summary

You can run this from the same `http://127.0.0.1:8080` web console.

The new Folo panel supports:

- paste your own Folo cookie
- choose `文章 / 社交 / 图片 / 视频`
- respect the requested display count and paginate `/entries` until it collects enough rows
- generate `summary.html` and `article.html`
- auto-curate:
  - `超级提高效率最优帮助`
  - `对 AI 研究最有启发`
- attach Chinese recommendation reasons to every highlighted item
- translate feed titles, summaries, and common keywords into Chinese for easier review

CLI entry is also available:

```bash
python folo_fetch.py --cookie "<your cookie>" --view 0 --limit 20
```

If you set `--limit 50`, the fetcher now requests more than one page when needed instead of stopping at the API's default first page size.

## Web console features

The local console in `web_app.py` is the main product surface.

- start tasks from the browser
- inspect task logs and progress
- reopen historical runs
- open generated HTML directly
- stop running tasks
- persist task metadata to disk
- run Folo timeline fetches from the same dashboard
- run Zhihu user activity exports from the same dashboard

## Ranking page extras

The generated `usefulness_ranking.html` is no longer just a sorted list.

It now also includes:

- `超级提高效率最优帮助`: posts that are most likely to improve workflows, tooling, and execution speed
- `对 AI 研究最有启发`: posts that are most likely to trigger ideas about models, training, evaluation, or agent systems
- Chinese recommendation reasons for every highlighted item so the page is readable without extra prompting

This makes the report more useful as a review surface, not just a dump of high-score posts.

For a repo like this, the console matters more than the crawler scripts. People star products, not script folders.

## Positioning

This is not a general-purpose scraping framework.

This is a local intelligence workbench for turning public social content into:

- readable reports
- ranked opportunities
- reusable research assets

Keeping that positioning narrow is important. Narrow tools spread better.

## Known constraints

- X flows depend on a valid logged-in browser session
- Folo / Zhihu / Xiaohongshu flows require user-provided cookies
- UI and scripts were optimized for practical output, not anti-fragile scraping at massive scale
- Some platform pages will still break when upstream HTML changes

## Security notes

- Do not commit your cookies or auth state files
- Use test accounts where possible
- Review generated reports before sharing externally

## Roadmap

- Better onboarding for first-time login and cookie setup
- Export packaged sample reports for instant preview
- Add source dedupe across platforms
- Add prompt-based ranking profiles like "investor", "operator", "creator"
- Add a one-command demo mode for GitHub visitors

## If you want this to become a real GitHub hit

The code is not enough. You also need distribution.

Ship in this order:

1. Clean repo name: `social-radar`
2. Short demo video: 30-45 seconds
3. Tweet: "I built a local app that turns X into ranked HTML reports"
4. Post screenshots before code snippets
5. Keep README above the fold brutally simple

That is how projects like this get their first 100 stars.
