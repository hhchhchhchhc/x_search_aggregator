## What it does

Social Radar turns noisy public content into something you can actually read and reuse.

- Search X by keyword and export a clean HTML report
- Crawl your following timeline and rank posts by usefulness
- Pull full answers from Zhihu questions or keyword results
- Pull Xiaohongshu note lists, full text, images, and comments
- Track progress in a local web console instead of staring at terminal logs
- Persist tasks locally so history survives page refreshes and service restarts

This repo is built for people doing:

- content research
- market monitoring
- creator scouting
- lead discovery
- trend validation

## Why people star this kind of repo

It has three traits that travel well on GitHub:

- One-sentence value proposition: "turn social media into ranked reports"
- Visual output: generated HTML pages are screenshot-friendly
- Zero platform API dependency for X: it runs on your logged-in browser session

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-name/social-radar.git
cd social-radar
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m playwright install chromium
```

Login to X once:

```bash
python login_x.py --state auth_state.json --timeout 180
```

Start the console:

```bash
python web_app.py
```

Then open:

```bash
http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

## Fastest path to first result

1. Run `python web_app.py`
2. Open the browser console
3. Enter an X keyword
4. Start a `Top 500` search
5. Wait for the report to finish
6. Open the generated HTML output

If your first run does not produce a shareable screenshot in under 10 minutes, the repo is not packaged well enough. That is the standard.

## Core workflows

### 1. X keyword search

```bash
python search_keyword_500.py --keyword "AI Agent" --lang zh
```

Output:

- keyword search results
- full-text hydration
- HTML article page
- usefulness ranking page

### 2. X following timeline ranking

```bash
python crawl_following_timeline_500.py
```

Output:

- latest following timeline items
- ranked report by usefulness
- HTML summaries for review

### 3. Zhihu question answers

```bash
python zhihu_question_answers.py \
  --question-url "https://www.zhihu.com/question/547768388" \
  --cookie "<your cookie>"
```

### 4. Zhihu keyword top 500

```bash
python zhihu_search_keyword_500.py \
  --keyword "自动驾驶强化学习" \
  --cookie "<your cookie>"
```

### 5. Xiaohongshu keyword top 500

```bash
python xiaohongshu_search_keyword_500.py \
  --keyword "AI 副业" \
  --cookie "<your cookie>"
```

## Web console features

The local console in `web_app.py` is the main product surface.

- start tasks from the browser
- inspect task logs and progress
- reopen historical runs
- open generated HTML directly
- stop running tasks
- persist task metadata to disk

For a repo like this, the console matters more than the crawler scripts. People star products, not script folders.

## Positioning

This is not a general-purpose scraping framework.

This is a local intelligence workbench for turning public social content into:

- readable reports
- ranked opportunities
- reusable research assets

Keeping that positioning narrow is important. Narrow tools spread better.

## Known constraints

- X flows depend on a valid logged-in browser session
- Zhihu and Xiaohongshu flows require user-provided cookies
- UI and scripts were optimized for practical output, not anti-fragile scraping at massive scale
- Some platform pages will still break when upstream HTML changes

## Security notes

- Do not commit your cookies or auth state files
- Use test accounts where possible
- Review generated reports before sharing externally

## Roadmap

- Better onboarding for first-time login and cookie setup
- Export packaged sample reports for instant preview
- Add source dedupe across platforms
- Add prompt-based ranking profiles like "investor", "operator", "creator"
- Add a one-command demo mode for GitHub visitors

## If you want this to become a real GitHub hit

The code is not enough. You also need distribution.

Ship in this order:

1. Clean repo name: `social-radar`
2. Short demo video: 30-45 seconds
3. Tweet: "I built a local app that turns X into ranked HTML reports"
4. Post screenshots before code snippets
5. Keep README above the fold brutally simple

That is how projects like this get their first 100 stars.
